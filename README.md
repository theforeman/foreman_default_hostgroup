# Foreman Default Hostgroup Plugin

A quick plugin to set a default hostgroup on hosts which check-in via Puppet without
a Hostgroup set.

## Installation

See [How_to_Install_a_Plugin](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/How_to_Install_a_Plugin)
for how to install Foreman plugins

## Compatibility

| Foreman Version | Plugin Version |
| --------------- | --------------:|
| <= 1.2          | 0.1.0          |
| >= 1.3          | 1.0.1          |

## Usage

The configuration is done inside foreman's plugin settings directory which is ```~foreman/config/settings.plugins.d/```.

You can simply copy ```default_hostgroup.yaml.example``` and adjust it to fit your needs. You should change the example settings as they might break your setup (very unlikely though).

*Important Note:* You have to restart foreman in order to apply changes in ```default_hostgroup.yaml```!

There are also two more settings under ```Settings -> DefaultHostgroup```

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| ```force_hostgroup_match``` | Setting this to ```true``` will perform matching even on hosts that already have a hostgroup set. Enabling this needs ```force_hostgroup_match_only_new``` to be ```false```.  Default: ```false``` |
| ```force_hostgroup_match_only_new``` | Setting this to ```true``` will only perform matching when a host uploads its facts for the first time, i.e. after provisioning or when adding an existing puppetmaster and thus its nodes into foreman. Default: ```true``` |


## TODO

* Deface the Hostgroup UI to add the regular expressions directly into the Hostgroup
