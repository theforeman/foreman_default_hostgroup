# Foreman Default Hostgroup Plugin

A quick plugin to set a default hostgroup on hosts which check-in via Puppet without
a Hostgroup set.

## Installation

See Foreman's [plugin installation documentation](https://theforeman.org/plugins/#2.Installation).

## Compatibility

| Foreman Version | Plugin Version |
| --------------- | --------------:|
| <= 1.2          | 0.1.0          |
|    1.3          | 1.0.1          |
|    1.4          | 1.1.0          |
|    1.5          | 2.0.1          |
| >= 1.6          | 3.0.0          |

## Usage

The configuration is done inside foreman's plugin settings directory which is
`/etc/foreman/plugins/`.

You can simply copy `default_hostgroup.yaml.example` and adjust it to fit
your needs. The format is shown in the example. The simplest form would be:

```
---
:default_hostgroup:
  :facts_map:
    "Default":
      "hostname": ".*"
```
If you are ugrading from plugin version 2.0.1 or older the format of this
file changes and you will need modify `default_hostgroup.yaml.example` to
follow the format above.

*Important Note:* You have to restart foreman in order to apply changes in
`default_hostgroup.yaml`!

There are also two more settings under `Settings -> DefaultHostgroup`

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `force_hostgroup_match` | Setting this to `true` will perform matching even on hosts that already have a hostgroup set. Enabling this needs `force_hostgroup_match_only_new` to be `false`.  Default: `false` |
| `force_hostgroup_match_only_new` | Setting this to `true` will only perform matching when a host uploads its facts for the first time, i.e. after provisioning or when adding an existing puppetmaster and thus its nodes into foreman. Default: `true` |

## TODO

* Deface the Hostgroup UI to add the regular expressions directly into the Hostgroup
